# Awesome-Hotends
A collection of 3D printer hotends.

The 3D printer hotend is the business end of FDM 3D printers, responsible for melting plastic from a solid to a molten state.

This is a list of popular all metal hotends compatible with common toolheads for Voron pritner, Printers for Ants, and other custom 3D printers. Non-standardized, PTFE lined, or proprietary hotends for  prebuilt machines shall typically be excluded unless widely adopted and supported by the community.

Looking for a toolhead to go with your extruder of choice? Check out [Awesome-Toolheads](https://github.com/SartorialGrunt0/Awesome-Toolheads).

### Standard Flow

Standard flow hotends are best suited for slower machines where higher flow hotends may lead to heat creep or are unneccessary. They typically have a max flow rate under 15 mm3/s. Many standard flow hotends can move into the high-flow category with meltzone extensions and CHT/filament split nozzles.

- [E3D V6]() - The OG hotend, supports V6 groove mount, V6 nozzles, max flow~12 mm3/s.
- [E3D Revo V6]() - The new and improved V6 hotend, support V6 groove mount, quick, cold swap nozzles, max flow~12 mm3/s.
- [E3D Revo Voron]()- Variant of E3D revo V6, supports dragon mounting.
- [E3D Panda Revo]() - Variant of E3D revo V6, supports Bambu mounting.
- [Dragon SF] - High quality hotend, supports dragon mounting, one-handed nozzle changes, max flow~15 mm3/s.
- [Dragonfly] -

### High Flow

High flow hotends are the most common type of hotend used today. They provide a balance of flow rate, standard nozzles, and size. They typically have a max flow rate under 25 mm3/s.

### Ultra High Flow

Ultra hign flow hotends are reserved for the fastest most demanding machines. They offer flow rates in the ranges of 30-50 mm3/s at the cost of heat creep, size, and sometimes non-standard nozzles.
