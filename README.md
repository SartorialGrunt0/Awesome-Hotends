# Awesome-Hotends
A collection of 3D printer hotends.

The 3D printer hotend is the business end of FDM 3D printers, responsible for melting plastic from a solid to a molten state.

This is a list of popular all metal hotends compatible with common toolheads for Voron pritner, Printers for Ants, and other custom 3D printers. Non-standardized, PTFE lined, or proprietary hotends for  prebuilt machines shall typically be excluded unless widely adopted and supported by the community.

### Standard Flow

Standard flow hotends are best suited for slower machines where higher flow hotends may lead to heat creep or are unneccessary. They typically have a max flow rate under 15 mm3/s. Many standard flow hotends can move into the high-flow category with meltzone extensions and CHT/filament split nozzles.
